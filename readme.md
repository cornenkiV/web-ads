## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker
-   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cornenkiV/web-ads.git
    cd web-ads
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    -   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Open the `.env` file and review the variables. For a standard local setup, the default values should work.


3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    -   From the root of the project, run the following command:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```
    -   The `--build` flag ensures that Docker images are rebuilt from scratch. The initial build may take a few minutes.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    -   Frontend Application: **http://localhost:3000**
    -   Backend API: **http://localhost:8080**

### Seeder Information

-   If `DB_SEED` is set to `true`, the database will be populated with **10 users** and **100 ads**.
-   The password for all seeded users is: `password`

### Stopping the Application

-   Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `docker-compose` is running.
-   To remove the containers and network run: `docker-compose down`
